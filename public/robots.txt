# Block Common AI Scrapers (Optional - adjust based on strategy)
# Blocking these prevents training but might limit "AI Search" visibility
# For "Zero-Click" optimization, we generally WANT to be seen by Search AIs (like SGE),
# but maybe not generic LLM scrapers.
# Google-Extended controls Bard/Vertex training but allows Search.
